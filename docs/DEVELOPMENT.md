# Development

Mirante4D currently develops and packages on Linux x86_64.

## Setup

1. Install Git and Linux build dependencies. On Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \
     libudev-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev \
     libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev
   ```

2. Install Rust through `rustup` and clone the repository. The checkout selects
   the pinned `rust-toolchain.toml` toolchain.
3. Install the tools pinned by the verification registry:

   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-nextest --version 0.9.138 --locked
   cargo install rumdl --version 0.2.30 --locked
   cargo install cargo-deny --version 0.20.2 --locked
   ```

Running the application also requires a working Vulkan-capable graphics
driver.

## Commands

Run the generated development dataset:

```bash
cargo xtask run-dev
```

Run the current PR profile or one focused leaf:

```bash
cargo xtask verify-pr
cargo xtask verify-leaf policy
cargo xtask verify-leaf lint
cargo xtask verify-leaf unit
cargo xtask verify-leaf contract
cargo xtask verify-leaf ui
cargo xtask verify-leaf doctest
```

Check generated verification files or documentation only:

```bash
cargo xtask verification-sync --check
cargo xtask docs-check
```

Discover the complete current command surface from the executable authority:

```bash
cargo xtask --help
```

`verify-pr policy` and `verify-pr rust` run one public group. The protected
repository requires the matching `PR / policy` and `PR / rust` checks; the
transitional Bootstrap command and workflow have been removed.

Trusted GPU verification is separate and requires the designated Vulkan
workstation:

```bash
MIRANTE4D_XTASK_ALLOW_TRUSTED_LOCAL=1 \
  cargo xtask verify-local trusted-gpu
```

## Working Rules

- Keep generated packages, private microscopy data, logs, and evidence under
  ignored local paths, never in the repository.
- Use focused checks while iterating, then run every gate required by the
  owning work package.
- Add a dependency only for a clear current need. Run
  `cargo xtask verify-deps`; exact exceptions live only in the
  [exception ledger](DEPENDENCY_EXCEPTIONS.md).
- Run `cargo fmt --all` for Rust changes and `cargo xtask docs-check` for
  documentation changes.
- Rendering, loading, GPU, interaction, and large-data changes require the
  real-product validation described in [testing](TESTING.md).
- Follow the high-risk entry workflow in [the agent guide](AGENTS.md) for
  architectural or broad corrective work.

Current packaging status and the local release-candidate command are in
[release](RELEASE.md).
